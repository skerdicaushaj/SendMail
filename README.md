# Send Mail

Solution of the task is by creating a tool that reads two API responses and sends an email. The email contain posts the 3 first posts written by every user as required in the test.
 
E.g. John Smith has written: 
- Title 1 
- Title 2 
- Title 3 

Paul Johnson has written: 
- Title 1 
- Title 2 
- Title 3 

*Tests with mocha (yarn test)
*Documentation on swagger (ex. http://localhost:your-port/api-docs)
*Also some simple api-s to get/post Users from DB and get/post Posts to DB.
